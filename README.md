# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the algorithms I created for MECH 105 numerical methods.
 ## False Position Algorithm
- This algorithm used the False Position root finding method to find the roots of the functions.
## LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting Algorithm
- This algorithm can be used to solve systems or equations using the LU factozization method.
## Simpson's 1/3 Rule Algorithm
- This algorithm uses the Simpsons 1/3 method to integrate.
