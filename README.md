# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the algorithms I created for MECH 105 numerical methods.
 **1. False Position Algorithm**
- This algorithm used the False Position root finding method to find the roots of the functions.
**2. LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting Algorithm**
- This algorithm can be used to solve systems or equations using the LU factozization method.
**3. Simpson's 1/3 Rule Algorithm**
- This used the Simpsons 1/3 method to integrate.
